🌐 AI Format Foundation (AIFF)
Open Standards for AI-Generated Media

The AI Format Foundation (AIFF) is an open, community-driven initiative creating transparent, verifiable, and future-proof file standards for AI-generated content.
Our mission is to give creators, developers, platforms, and archivists a consistent way to document authorship, provenance, prompts, toolchains, and verification status across all major forms of AI media.

🧩 AIFF Core Standards
🎵 AIM — AI Music Format (.aim)

A structured, ZIP-based container for storing:

Audio (mp3, wav)

Prompts

Stems

Metadata

Authorship + verification info

🎬 AIV — AI Video Format (.aiv)

Supports:

Video files

Scene prompts

Storyboards

Audio tracks

Model + toolchain metadata

Verification fields

🖼 AII — AI Image Format (.aii)

Stores:

Final image

Prompt + negative prompt

Model seeds

Variations

Edits

Verification tier

📁 AIP — AI Project Format (.aip)

A multi-asset project container for:

Timelines

Sequences

Audio, video, image assets

Editor steps

Provenance trail

Verification badges

Each standard is built for long-term reliability and interoperability.

🛡️ AFF-VS: Verification System 1.0

AIFF introduces a universal verification model used across all formats:

🟡 Tier 1 — Self-Declared Authenticity (SDA)

Creator manually enters metadata.
Lowest trust level.

🔵 Tier 2 — Verified Creator (VC)

Email verified + authorship statement signed.
Required for monetization and professional profiles.

🟢 Tier 3 — Platform Verified Authenticity (PVA)

Metadata verified via API (Suno, Veo, Runway, SDXL, etc.).
Highest trust level.

Verification metadata is stored directly in each format’s manifest.json.

⚖️ Legal & Authorship Protection

AIFF standards include best-practice documentation to help creators:

Record human creative contribution

Establish provenance

Support copyright eligibility

Document editing steps

Clarify the origin of AI-generated content

See the repo files:

COPYRIGHT-GUIDANCE.md

LEGAL-DISCLAIMER.md

HUMAN-AUTHORSHIP-STATEMENT.md

🚀 Our Vision

AI-generated content is exploding, but metadata transparency is missing.

AIFF aims to become the industry standard for:

AI music publishing

AI filmmaking workflows

AI art archiving

Cross-tool interoperability

Verification & fraud prevention

Long-term provenance for creative works

This is the equivalent of EXIF for AI Images,
ID3 tags for AI Music,
and project archives for AI production tools — all unified.

🤝 Welcome Creators, Developers, and Platforms

Anyone can implement the formats.
Anyone can build tools.
Anyone can contribute.

AIFF is creating a transparent, trustworthy future for AI media — one standard at a time.
