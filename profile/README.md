🌐 AI First Exchange (AIFX)
Open Standards for AI-Generated Media

The AI First Exchange (AIFX) is an open, community-driven initiative creating transparent, integrity-verifiable, and future-proof file standards for AI-generated content. Our mission is to give creators, developers, platforms, and archivists a consistent way to document authorship, provenance, prompts, toolchains, and verification status across all major forms of AI media.

🧩 AIFX Core Formats
🎵 AIFM — AI First Music Format (.aifm)

A structured, ZIP-based container for storing:

Audio (.mp3, .wav, etc.)

Prompts

Stems (optional)

Metadata

Authorship + verification fields

🎬 AIFV — AI First Video Format (.aifv)

Supports:

Video files

Scene prompts

Storyboards

Audio tracks (optional)

Model + toolchain metadata

Verification fields

🖼 AIFI — AI First Image Format (.aifi)

Stores:

Final image

Prompt + negative prompt

Model/seed parameters (where available)

Variations and edits (optional)

Verification tier

📁 AIFP — AI First Project Format (.aifp)

A multi-asset project container for:

Timelines / sequences

Audio, video, and image assets

Editor steps (optional)

Provenance trail

Verification badges

Each format is a ZIP-based container with a manifest.json manifest and standardized folders.

🛡️ AIFX-VS: Verification System 1.0

AIFX introduces a universal verification model used across all formats:

🟡 Tier 1 — Self-Declared Authenticity (SDA)

Creator manually enters metadata. Lowest trust level.

🔵 Tier 2 — Verified Creator (VC)

Identity verified + authorship statement signed. Recommended for monetization and professional profiles.

🟢 Tier 3 — Platform Verified Authenticity (PVA)

Metadata verified via trusted pipelines or platform integrations (where available). Highest trust level.

Verification metadata is stored directly in each format’s manifest.json.

Verification tiers attest to metadata completeness, integrity, and signing status—not absolute proof of origin outside the recorded workflow.

⚖️ Legal & Authorship Protection

AIFX standards include best-practice documentation to help creators:

Record human creative contribution

Establish provenance

Support copyright eligibility (where applicable)

Document editing steps

Clarify the origin and workflow of AI-generated media

See:

COPYRIGHT-GUIDANCE.md

LEGAL-DISCLAIMER.md

HUMAN-AUTHORSHIP-STATEMENT.md

🚀 Our Vision

AI-generated content is exploding, but metadata transparency is missing.

AIFX aims to become the industry standard for:

AI music publishing

AI filmmaking workflows

AI art archiving

Cross-tool interoperability

Verification & fraud prevention

Long-term provenance for creative works

This is the equivalent of EXIF for AI images, ID3 for AI music, and project archives for AI production tools — all unified.

🤝 Welcome Creators, Developers, and Platforms

Anyone can implement the formats.
Anyone can build tools.
Anyone can contribute.

AIFF is creating a transparent, trustworthy future for AI media — one standard at a time.
