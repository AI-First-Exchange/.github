# AI First Exchange (AIFX) — Manifesto

## Our Purpose

Artificial intelligence is transforming how music, video, images, and creative works are produced.  
However, systems for documenting origin, authorship, provenance, and workflow context have not kept pace.

The **AI First Exchange (AIFX)** exists to define **open, inspectable, and interoperable standards** for AI-generated and AI-assisted media — enabling transparency without imposing ownership, control, or judgment.

AIFX is built to support creators, developers, platforms, archivists, and future systems that rely on trustworthy metadata rather than opaque assertions.

## Our Principles

**Open Standards Over Lock-In**  
AIFX standards are open, extensible, and implementation-agnostic. No platform, company, or individual owns the formats.

**Documentation Over Assertion**  
AIFX focuses on recording declared information — prompts, parameters, toolchains, and human involvement — rather than enforcing truth claims.

**Transparency Over Opacity**  
Metadata should be inspectable, portable, and durable across tools and time.

**Creator Agency Over Platform Control**  
Creators decide how their work is documented. Platforms decide how they interpret it. AIFX does not arbitrate between them.

**Interoperability Over Silos**  
AIFX formats are designed to move freely between tools, ecosystems, and generations of technology.

## What AIFX Is

- A neutral exchange for AI-first media formats  
- A documentation-oriented standards initiative  
- A community-driven effort focused on interoperability  
- A framework for declared provenance and authorship context  

AIFX defines **formats**, not platforms.

---

## What AIFX Is Not

- Not a certification authority  
- Not a copyright registry  
- Not a legal arbiter  
- Not a marketplace or distribution platform  
- Not an enforcement mechanism  

AIFX does not determine ownership, authenticity, legality, or value.

---

## On Authorship & Verification

AIFX standards allow creators to **declare human involvement, creative decisions, and tool usage** through structured metadata.

Verification tiers document **how metadata was supplied or confirmed**, not whether it is legally valid or factually true.

Interpretation, enforcement, and legal significance are determined by:
- Applicable law  
- Platforms and services  
- Rights holders and courts  

AIFX provides the structure — not the judgment.

---

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

- Maintaining open, stable specifications  
- Avoiding vendor-specific dependencies  
- Supporting forward compatibility  
- Welcoming community participation  
- Preserving neutrality and transparency  

AIFX exists to serve the ecosystem — not to control it.

---

## Stewardship

AIFX standards evolve through open discussion, versioned specifications, and public contribution.

No single entity governs creative expression.  
Our role is to ensure the **records endure**, even as tools change.
